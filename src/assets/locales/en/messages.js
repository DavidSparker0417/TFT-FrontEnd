Through our governance structure, fans will have a real say in their club’s operations.\nAnyone who owns at least one of The Fans Together’s $TFT tokens will be able to debate, contribute and ultimately decide, through votes and polls the direction of their  sports clubs. Votes within the DAO are proposed by the TFT team and then token  holders will be able to participate, deciding the outcome.\nWe have opted to use IOTA’s Tangle because of its many advantages, its fast, feeless,  and energy efficient. These features are what make The Fans Together possible.","about.white.desc0":"Want to have a look at what our plans for TFT are?<0/>Take a look at our whitepaper here.","article.desc":"Here you can keep up to date with everything happening with The Fans Together","donate.main.desc":"The Fans Together is working hard to bring sports fans and pro clubs closer. Our donation info is below.","faq.a1":"The Fans Together is a DAO (see below) using Web3 technology and the IOTA Tangle to bring sports fans               together and give them the power to have a real say in sports clubs, instead of being left out of the decision making.","faq.a2":"A Decentralised Autonomous Community is a group of individuals that, through Web3 technology,  come together to collectively make decisions.","faq.a3":"We found that now was the time through a confluence of developments in technology and in sports. We were energised by the mobilisation of fans against the unjust European Super League proposals. The IOTA Foundations pace of progress, to mature its technology, has continued and we feel that IOTA is developed enough to provide what we need for this project.","faq.a4":"Simply, it allows for decentralised operability, is transparent and immutable, and in the context of our ownership and voting model, allows token holders to participate in managing the DAOs direction and acquisition strategy. The subsequent management of sporting clubs through the Tangle provides the project significant credibility and trust, while also allowing for a wide range of participation and selectability of interest areas for the participant. The Tangle enables rapid scaling, access speed, and visibility  across all aspects of operations.","faq.a5":"The fact that with IOTA the transactions are feeless and frictionless is a significant advantage over operating our DAO on any other cryptocurrency. Another draw is that the IOTA Tangle functions in a much less energy intensive way meaning that we can have the functionality of a digital ledger, without the  costs to the environment and sustainability that other cryptocurrencies such as Ethereum impose.","faq.a6":"Currently only the #DAOPIONEER is available as a piece of physical apparel.","faq.a7":"We can’t promise it, as each purchase decision will be proposed, debated and approved by the membership of the DAO, but we can encourage you to get involved and make your voice heard.","help.contact.desc":"Haven't found what you need in our FAQ?","home.donate.p0":"The Fans Together is working hard to bring sports fans and pro clubs closer.
